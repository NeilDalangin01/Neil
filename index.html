        This is my very first website I've made so far ever in my entire life. I'm really having a hard time searching for simple tutorials that would suits in my intelligent capacities and <b> I'm extremely thrilled by what I have done so far!!! </b>

           <h5>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h5>

            <p>
              I am <B>Juniel A. Dalangin</B>, 21 years old. I am currently residing at <u>329 Zone 3, Barra, Opol, Misamis Oriental.</u> I was born and raised in the said province. I went to Barra Elementary School in my primary school years, I am a proud bulua product in Bulua National High School in my junior high school level and finally a senior high school graduate from one of the prestigious school in the city, Liceo de Cagayan University under HUMSS strand. Now, I take up BSTCM since BSED major in english isn't offer in the school and there's many job opportunities in the future within this course and so I taken it up. My mom once told me when I was still in her womb, she thought I am a girl and maybe that's the reason why I am gay today. But, my uncle and my cousin are gay including my brother, perhaps it really runs in our bloods.

            <p>
              I am currently taking the program <i>Technology Communication Management.</i> When I was still in elementary, I  wanted to become a doctor someday because I can help many people through aiding and giving them medical assistance but <u> disseminating information of what’s happening around will give much great benefits towards the citizen’s in the community</u> and so I think being a radio broadcaster or radio announcer is the best job to offer. I am interested in it because it connects to my dream career as news caster and it also has many job opportunities in the future incline to this course.

            </p>
            
            
              My first and primary personal goals for this class is to <strong>my skills in verbal and written communication typically in public speaking and essays.</strong> I want to be fluent in speaking in English and be better at using it since it is useful skill in every career job you’ll be applying for. Also, decoding my thoughts into verbal is one of my weakness and so I want to overcome them.

            Here's something unique about my self that most people probably don't know:
            <ul>
              <li>I am a <b>dancer</b> in my barangay, we compete with other barangays in a inter-barangay competition when there is festival.</li>
              <li>I do <b>massage</b> to my relatives and they’d loving it. </li>
              <li>I don’t have a <b>nice voice but I could sing</b> and <b>dancing</b> are my things I usually do.</li>
              <li>I do <b>love reading</b> but it’s not my hobby</li>
              <li>I am an unpaid <b>photographer</b></li>
              <li>I do <b>love taking photos and videos</b> particularly sunsets and sunrise in any ordrinary day.</li>
            </ul>
